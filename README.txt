Project Summary:
BestBoggle is (will be) a program to find all possible words in a Boggle game.
In a game of Boggle, a 4x4 grid of random letters is visable to both players. The goal is to find as many words as possible that can be constructed from adjacent letters on the grid. Words are subject to the following rules:

1. There are no more than four adjacent letters to each letter; diagonals are not allowed. 
2. The letters must appear in the correct order (of an english word).
3. A single element of the grid can only be used once within a word.
4. Different words can use the same elements.

BestBoggle will allow for a user inputed grid, or for a randomly generated grid.
