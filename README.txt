# Shugerman_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
BoggleSolve is (will be) a program to find all possible words in a Boggle game.
In a game of Boggle, a 4x4 grid of random letters is visable to both players. The goal is to find as many words as possible that can be constructed from adjacent letters on the grid. Words are subject to the following rules:

1. There are up to eight letters adjacent to each (diagonals are allowed).
2. The letters must be adjacent to each other in the correct order.
3. A given element of the grid can only be used once within a word.
4. Different words can use the same elements.
5. A word must contain at least 3 letters.

BoggleSolve will allow for a user inputed grid, or for a randomly generated grid.
